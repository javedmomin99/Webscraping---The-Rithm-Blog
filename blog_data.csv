This week, we caught up with Harry Teplow (Rithm’s 16th cohort, aka r16) and Lucas Pagac (r19), who recently landed jobs with Google.

Three Rithm Students Accepted to the 2022 Pinterest Engineering Internship,/blog/pinterest-internship,"<p>With over 1000 applicants this year, the Pinterest Apprenticeship Program is a highly competitive opportunity for software engineers from non-traditional backgrounds (like bootcamp grads) to experience engineering at Pinterest. Apprenticeships are up to one year long with the opportunity to be considered for conversion to a full-time engineer. We’re thrilled to announce that of the 23 people accepted as Pinterns this year, 3 are Rithm grads! We took a few minutes to chat with Vanessa Cheng, Kimberly Lin, and Jenny Liu (all from Rithm’s 23rd cohort) about their experience applying for the role and what their time at Pinterest has been like so far.</p>",2022-05-13 15:59:12 UTC,"May 13, 2022"
The Top 5 Questions People Ask About Rithm School,/blog/top-5-admissions-questions,"<p>Taking the dive into a coding bootcamp is a big commitment, and it’s important that you have all the information available to you before you decide whether it’s right for you. At Rithm School, we take the time to talk to each individual prospective student so that you can put a human face to our team and learn about the people who you’ll be working with. That process begins with admissions calls, where you’ll have the opportunity to ask any questions about our program that you might have. While every call is different, there are common questions that you may have when beginning your bootcamp search.</p>",2022-03-21 14:02:41 UTC,"March 21, 2022"

Student Interview: R20 On Remote Company Projects ,/blog/student-interview-clever-counsel-company-projects,"<p>At Rithm, we believe that one of the best ways to prepare students for jobs as web developers is by giving them opportunities to work on real-world projects. Working on personal projects can be fun, but working in a team or on an existing code base gives students insights into the day-to-day challenges of a developer that they might not otherwise learn. One of the company projects our 20th cohort is completing is a web application that streamlines the process of workers making wage dispute claims against their employers.<strong> </strong>We asked two of our students, Julia and Kathrin, to share their experience working together with us:</p>",2021-05-25 23:55:52 UTC,"May 25, 2021"
Good Ideas for Better Variable Names,/blog/good-ideas-for-better-variable-names,"<p dir=""ltr"">A large part of professional programming is communicating clearly with other developers: almost no serious software projects are written by a single author, and it's common for dozens of programmers to be able to understand your code.</p>",2021-05-04 21:10:26 UTC,"May 04, 2021"
TypeScript: How To Get Started,/blog/typescript-how-to-get-started,"<p>TypeScript is a language extention to JavaScript that is so hot right now. Looking at the <a href=""https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#overview"">2020 developer survey</a> from stack overflow, you can see that TypeScript continues to gain ground in both popularity and love for the language.

3 Patterns for Refactoring Your Code,/blog/three-simple-patterns-for-refactoring-your-code,"<p>When I review code written by people who are relatively new to programming, I find myself often repeating the same advice. There are many patterns we adopt as we learn to code that we have to unlearn or modify once we become more comfortable with the fundamentals. In this post, I'd like to highlight three common patterns I see, and how you can refactor them to write code that is more readable, and often more concise.</p>",2021-04-12 16:28:16 UTC,"April 12, 2021"

The practice of offering scholarships is not only a way to support learners working with tight budgets, but also a method of engaging and motivating nontraditional students of all backgrounds and experience levels who are interested in breaking into tech.

Our Updated Interview Process,/blog/our-updated-interview-process,"<p>At Rithm, our goal is to make our admissions process fair, personalized, and informative, and over the past couple of years, we've seen that candidates have highly enjoyed our admissions process and interviews. At the same time, we've seen that our application process is longer than most, as it requires students to complete a large set of practice problems before interviewing. While this has been a helpful way for candidates to practice problem-solving, it has not always led to the most seamless interview process. In order to make it easier to interview at Rithm School, we're making a slight modification to our interview process.</p>",2021-01-25 20:19:48 UTC,"January 25, 2021"

Seven Tips For Dealing With Imposter Syndrome,/blog/dealing-with-coding-bootcamp-imposter-syndrome,"<p>Imposter syndrome is a phenomenon where people doubt their skills, talents, and/or accomplishments. They have a constant fear of being exposed as a fraud, and think things like, “eventually everyone will find out that I really have no idea what I’m doing.” Even after one gets a job this can still occur, they would attribute getting a job to pure luck.</p>",2020-10-20 00:00:00 UTC,"October 20, 2020"

How To Get Into A Top Coding Bootcamp,/blog/how-to-get-into-top-coding-bootcamp-rithm-school,"<p>Getting into a selective bootcamp can be difficult. This is a good thing, you want to avoid schools that admit anyone who is willing to pay. There are too many schools that are more focused on building a big business rather than the outcomes of their students. Even after going through a leading bootcamp, getting the first job can still be difficult. Stay away from places that make it seem easy. It is much better to be surrounded by others who have put in a lot of effort into being there.</p>",2020-09-22 00:00:00 UTC,"September 22, 2020"
